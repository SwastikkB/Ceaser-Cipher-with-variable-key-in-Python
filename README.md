# Rotation/Caeser-Cipher-with-variable-key-in-Python
Encrypts Normal text into cipher text with any key which can be entered by user , made using very basic python

what this program does it that it contains a dictionary with alphabet:number as key:value pair 
using this it converts the text entered by the user into numbers and then adds the key entered by user to it 
then it gets the value of letter to the corresponding key from the original dictionary and displays the shifted letter

note: the title has rotation AND caeser because the shift value can be anything and caeser is just a special case of rotation cipher when the shift key is 3.


note:ALSO for decrypting the file , set the shift key to (21-x) where x is the shift key in reverse , for example we want to decrypt by 7 so we will enter our key as 21-7 which is 14.
